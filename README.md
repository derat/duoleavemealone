# duoleavemealone

**duoleavemealone** is a Chrome [content script extension] that modifies the
[Duolingo] language-learning website. It can be installed via the [Chrome Web
Store].

This extension automatically clicks the "Continue" button to skip through
certain screens:

*   Correct answer
*   Completed lesson
*   Motivational messages
*   Pre-practice/checkpoint/test screens

The messages that would be displayed after correct answers or completed lessons
are briefly displayed onscreen instead.

Note that motivational message skipping can be unreliable. Luckily, Duolingo
provides a setting to disable these now.

[Rex501st] maintains a [Firefox version of duoleavemealone].

**This extension is not affiliated with Duolingo in any way.**
